# Favorite Games

I play a large variety of different video games. Some of these games are solo and some are multiplayer. 

**Destiny 2:** 
One of my favorite games of all time is *Destiny 2*. The far future that you play in exploring and fighting enemies across the solar system has always been very fun 
and engaging.

**Call of Duty:** 
It is very hard to pin down my favorite *Call of Duty* game so I need to just lump them all together. Whether it be zombies or multiplayer, something always brings me back 
to *Call of Duty*. Recently I have really enjoyed the weapon camo grinding aspect of the game and see it as a fun challenge with very cool rewards. 

**Legend of Zelda:**
This is another franchise with way too many good games. I really love the older *Legend of Zelda* games but the new ones have been good too. The one I find myself going 
back to playing the most is *The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time*. The way the game plays and the story always has me playing it at least once a year.
