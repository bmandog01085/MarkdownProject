# My Job and Career

For the past 6 months I have been working at St. Luke's Hospital as a cybersecurity intern. I have really enjoyed all of the work that I do and 
I feel that I have learned more than I have at school with my time working there. Nothing compares to on-the-job work and training. I am hoping to recieve a 
job offer once I graduate so that I can work full-time. If I don't get the job, I still want to find a good job that focuses on cybersecurity and data protection.
