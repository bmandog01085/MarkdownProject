# My Hobbies

This page is dedicated to some of my favorite ways to pass the time. 

**Video Games**
When I get home from work and school I love to play Xbox with my friends on a variety of different games. Lately these are the games I have played the most:

- Call of Duty Black Ops 6
- Resident Evil 4
- The Outlast Trials
- Forza Motorsport

**Music**
Sometimes I like to relax and listen to music whenever I study or work. My favorite artist is Logic, with AJR being a close second. 
I can't imagine living my life without music.

**Reading**
Lately I have been reading books and listening to audio books. Recently my favorite music artist released a novel titled Ultra 85 and it has been amazing.
Sometimes I read at home and listen to audiobooks when I go to work.
